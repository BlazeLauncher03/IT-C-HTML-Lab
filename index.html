            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> at the university. I initially started in <em>Electrical Engineering</em>, but switched to Cybersecurity over the summer as I discovered my passion for protecting systems and networks from threats.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've learned programming languages like Python and JavaScript, as well as fundamental concepts in web development and database management. These skills are essential for understanding both how to build secure systems and how to identify vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Technology has always been at the center of my interests. I'm fascinated by <strong>computers</strong> and keeping up with the <em>latest tech</em> developments. I have a particular interest in <strong>virtual reality (VR)</strong> and the immersive experiences it can create.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy working with <strong>servers</strong> and understanding how networked systems operate. Whether it's setting up server infrastructure or exploring new technologies, I'm always eager to learn and experiment with cutting-edge innovations.</p>
